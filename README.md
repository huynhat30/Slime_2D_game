# Slime_2D_game
Super Slime is a 2D game that bases on Platformer genre. This game is made by taking inspiration from previous games such as Super Mario, Ori, Kerby, Dead Cells and so on. The main character of this game is nothing but a Slime, which can move forward, backward and jump to collect items and gain point. 

This is a small project I made in Game programming course.
